An interactive dashboard is a visual representation of data allowing the users to interact with and explore information in a dynamic and user-friendly way. It typically consists of various data visualizations, charts, graphs, tables, and other components from which insights and information can be derived. It is often used as a business data management tool to monitor and display key business metrics by allowing the users to drill down and filter operational information so data can be viewed from different perspectives or in more detail.

This interactive dashboard on Adidas' sales in the USA was created in Excel using the relevant dataset. It dynamically updates based on the end user's preferences that are determined by the filters that they use such as the year, region and product. Pivot tables are created in different sheets to analyse the relevant information. Different charts and visualisations were made using the respective pivot tables by using the Pivot Chart feature. When that was completed the dashboard was designed using the formatting tools. The graphs that were created earlier were copied to the Dashboard sheet and formatted to fit its theme. The dashboard was make dynamic by inserting slicers that act as filters. Finally, each slicer was linked to the data by reporting the connections.
